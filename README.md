## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before installing Jarvis, ensure you have the following:

1. Python 3.7 or higher
2. Home Assistant instance set up and running
3. OpenRGB (optional, for RGB lighting control)
4. Git (for cloning the repository)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. Clone the Jarvis repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis-voice-assistant.git
   cd jarvis-voice-assistant
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Copy the example configuration file:
   ```
   cp config.ini.example config.ini
   ```

5. Edit `config.ini` with your specific settings:
   - Set your Porcupine access key
   - Configure your OpenAI API key
   - Add your Home Assistant access token and URL
   - Adjust other settings as needed

6. Run the assistant:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Configuration

The `config.ini` file allows you to customize various aspects of Jarvis. Here's a detailed breakdown of each section:

### PORCUPINE
- `ACCESS_KEY`: Your Porcupine API key (string)
- `SENSITIVITY`: Wake word detection sensitivity (float between 0 and 1, e.g., 0.5)

### STT (Speech-to-Text)
- `PROVIDER`: Choose your STT provider ("google" or "whisper")

### OPENAI
- `API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (string)

### HOME_ASSISTANT
- `ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your Home Assistant long-lived access token (string)
- `URL`: The URL of your Home Assistant instance (e.g., "https://your-home-assistant-url.com")

### OPENRGB
- `ENABLED`: Enable or disable RGB lighting control (true or false)
- `DEVICE_TYPE`: The type of RGB device to control (e.g., "MICROPHONE", "KEYBOARD", etc.)

### AUDIO
- `CHIME_FILE`: The filename of your chime sound (e.g., "chime.mp3")
- `KITCHEN_SPEAKER`: The entity ID of your kitchen speaker in Home Assistant (e.g., "media_player.kitchen_display")

Ensure all API keys and tokens are kept secret and not shared publicly. Adjust these settings according to your specific setup and preferences.


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the console output for error messages.
2. Ensure all API keys and tokens in `config.ini` are correct.
